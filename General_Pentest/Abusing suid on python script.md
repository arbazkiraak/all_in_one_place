Abusing suid on python script

## Play with the libraries of the script

- You have suid on python script

- identify the function of the library

- create a library (example ```shutil.py```) which is used in the script, and a function executed in the script (```make_archive``` for example) with the same number of arguments even if you will not use it

- do whatever you want inside this function

- if the script is located in the same folder of the other script, run and enjoy it

- if not, run this : ```python -c 'import sys; print "\n".join(sys.path)'``` to get the list of the directories of the libraries

- if you can write it it's good

- if not, try to specify a path before running your script : ```sudo PYTHONPATH=/tmp/path_of_fake_library/``` ... This one, in order to work, needs this line when you list your rights : 

```
sudo -l
(ALL) SETENV: <program>
```

- The PYTHONPATH variable has a value that is a string with a list of directories that Python should add to the sys.path directory list.

- The main use of PYTHONPATH is when we are developing some code that we want to be able to import from Python, but that we have not yet made into an installable Python package (see: making a Python package).

- This variable is in python3, don't know if it exists in python2.
