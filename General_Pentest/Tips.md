## Problem with output

When something doesn't appear after trying to execute a payload on a website, try use ```2>&1``` at the end

To test it locally, if you enter ```nc -h >/dev/null``` and you doesn't see output, it's because the output is in standard error (stderr). By default it prints standard ouput (stdout).
