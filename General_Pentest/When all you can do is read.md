### Common web app files:
```c:\inetpub\wwwroot\index.asp``` 
- And other common variations, also check for any other files you can browse to.
        
### web.config in every directory you are traversing through
```
c:\windows\system32\logfiles\httperr\httperr1.log
c:\system32\inetsrv\Metabase.xml
```

### .NET framework files 

Check in ```c:\windows\microsoft.net\framework``` for different versions.

### A quick pair for permissions, if you can read these it shows you can read files owned by the Administrator

```
c:\documents and settings\administrator\ntuser.ini
c:\documents and settings\administrator\desktop\desktop.ini
```

## Linux

### ssh keys

- You've got the root user to try but if you've managed some user enumeration then you might be able to check their home directories as well. The files you are looking for are all in the .ssh directory :
```
authorized_keys
id_rsa
id_rsa.keystore
id_rsa.pub
known_hosts
```

### If you manage to get the known_hosts file then you can use this toolto decode it

### .gnupg directory

```
gpg.conf
pubring.gpg
pubring.gpg~
random_seed
secring.gpg
trustdb.gpg
```

### Some entries from the proc could be useful:

```
/proc/mounts
/proc/config.gz
/proc/self/fd/fd[0-9]*
```

### Other things from the users home directories:
```
.bash_history
.mysql_history
.my.cnf
```
