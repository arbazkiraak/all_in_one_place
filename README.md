# all_in_one_place

This repo is used to share what I learnt during CTFs, work, courses etc. 

## How to 

I like to have all the information I need in one place, to search with keywords. I used ```Joplin``` to take my notes, so the `jex` file is also here if you want to import it directly in ```Joplin```. Then simply type ```F6``` to search in all the notes. Or import the markdwown in the tool you want and search what you need :)
